## HTML Guidelines

When working with HTML, it is important to follow certain guidelines to ensure clean and maintainable code. These guidelines include using proper indentation, organizing code into sections, using appropriate naming conventions, and commenting code when necessary.

## Creating the Skeleton of an HTML5 Page

To create the skeleton of an HTML5 page, you need to define the basic structure using the HTML5 doctype and opening and closing `<html>` tags. Inside the `<html>` tags, you can add the `<head>` section for metadata and the `<body>` section for the content of the web page.

## Using Semantic HTML Tags

Semantic HTML tags provide meaning and structure to the content of a web page. They help search engines and assistive technologies understand the purpose of different sections. Common semantic tags include `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<aside>`. Each tag has its own semantic value and should be used appropriately.

## div vs span Use Cases

The `<div>` and `<span>` tags are both used for grouping elements, but they have different use cases. `<div>` is a block-level element used to group larger sections of content, while `<span>` is an inline element used for smaller, more specific sections or to apply styles to a specific part of the text.

## Semantic Value of HTML Tags

- `<header>`: Represents the introductory content or a container for the site's heading.
- `<main>`: Defines the main content of a document or a section within a document.
- `<footer>`: Represents the footer of a document or a section.
- `<article>`: Represents a self-contained composition that can be independently distributed or reusable.
- `<nav>`: Represents a section of a page that contains navigation links.
- `<section>`: Represents a standalone section that can be semantically separated from the rest of the page.
- `<aside>`: Represents a section of the page that contains content that is tangentially related to the main content.

## Using Headings

Headings in HTML are denoted by the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags. It is important to follow the hierarchical order when using headings. The `<h1>` tag represents the highest level of heading, while `<h6>` represents the lowest level. Using headings correctly helps in structuring the content and improves accessibility.

## Creating Lists

HTML provides different types of lists: unordered lists (`<ul>`), orderedlists (`<ol>`), and definition lists (`<dl>`). Unordered lists are used for presenting items in no particular order, ordered lists are used for presenting items in a specific order, and definition lists are used for defining terms and their corresponding definitions.

## Differences between Media Types

Different media types in HTML include SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), GIF (Graphics Interchange Format), PNG (Portable Network Graphics), and JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group). Each media type has its own characteristics and best use cases. SVG is ideal for vector graphics, GIF for short animations, PNG for lossless compression, and JPG for photographic images with lossy compression.

## Structuring Data in a Table

Tables in HTML are created using the `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` tags. The `<table>` tag represents the entire table, `<tr>` represents a row, `<th>` represents a header cell, and `<td>` represents a data cell. Tables are useful for organizing and presenting tabular data.

## Integrating Video

To integrate a video into a webpage, you can use the `<video>` tag. You need to specify the source of the video using the `<source>` tag within the `<video>` tag. Additionally, you can set attributes like width, height, autoplay, and controls to customize the video playback.

## Integrating Audio

Similar to video integration, you can use the `<audio>` tag to integrate audio files into a webpage. You can specify the source of the audio using the `<source>` tag within the `<audio>` tag. Attributes like autoplay, controls, and loop can be used to control the audio playback.

## Embedding External Content

HTML allows you to embed external content such as videos, audio, or other web pages using different tags. For example, you can use the `<iframe>` tag to embed external web pages, the `<embed>` tag to embed media content, or the `<object>` tag for more complex embedding scenarios.

## Structuring an HTML Page

A well-structured HTML page follows a standard structure to ensure proper organization and readability. It typically includes the doctype declaration, `<html>` tags, `<head>` section for metadata, and `<body>` section for the main content. Properly structuring an HTML page improves code maintenance and accessibility.
